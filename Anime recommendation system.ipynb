    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "It was really interesting to use a huge anime dataset to create a recommender system that could be used in real case scenarios. We tried to keep a critical oversight of our throughout the whole process of writing this program, in order to understand its limits but also its strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using graphs to explore our data was a very efficient way for us to understand the global structure of this dataset, and to visualize it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We understood how to use association rules for a case that is more relatable than just doing groceries, on a large dataset. We discovered that a lot of small things had to be taken into account to make the generated rules really relevant, but we think we did a good job in the end. Of course, this doesn't mean there are no improvements to be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Possible improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instead of using the animes in a user watchlist to train the system, we could try to use it to evaluate how good our system is. The global idea would be : __Are most of the recommended animes in the user watchlist ?__\n",
    "\n",
    "2. With more computing power, we could also compute more rules to find less common patterns that apply only to niche anime fans."
